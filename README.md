#  K-Drama EDA Project  

##  Introduction  
This project explores the world of **K-Dramas** through an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** approach.  
The goal is to identify trends, popular genres, audience preferences, and other insights from the dataset.  

##  Dataset

  - Title  
  - Year of Release  
  - Number of Episodes  
  - Genre  
  - Ratings  
  - Cast/Actors  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to ensure accuracy before analysis.  

##  Methods  
The following steps were carried out during the analysis:  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent formats.  
   - Extracted and normalized genres, actors, and release years.  

2. **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**  
   - Distribution of ratings, episodes, and release years.  
   - Genre frequency analysis.  
   - Actor frequency and performance analysis.  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Bar plots, line charts, and trend analysis using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.  

## Key Insights  
- Steady growth in the number of K-Dramas produced over the years.  
- Audience ratings remain strong, averaging around **8.3–8.4**.  
- **Romance** is the most common genre, while **Military** dramas achieve the **highest ratings**.
